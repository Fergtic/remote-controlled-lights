# remote-controlled-lights

Here is the result of a family holiday in a caravan park in Filey, where my bed was so far from the lights and I just wished that there was a remote control to turn the lights on and off. So as soon as I got home, instead of just buying some remote controlled lights, I got to work. This uses a IR receiver, arduino, servos and an old remote control
